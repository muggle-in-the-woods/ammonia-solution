  In this project I:
  - built a Mass percentage vs. Temperature calibrating plot with data provided;
  - found analytically boiling point temperature for 15%, 25% and 50% NH3 mass concentration;
  - found boiling temperature change with respect to NH3 mass percentage change by 1%. 
  Knowing two ‘critical’ boiling temperature points, that corresponds to 0% and 100% of NH3 concentration, I predicted what overall shape
function dependence would have. Then, using the equation that describes that shape, I built a trend line and found points of interest on it.

  To make it easier to understand the magnitude of boiling temperature change, I specified certain regions with their own boiling 
temperature change tendency. Firstly, it’s clear that T = f(NH3 concentration) dependence is non-linear, secondly slope doesn’t drastically change 
in the next ranges of NH3 mass concentration: [0% - 40%], [40% - 60%], [60% - 80%], [80% - 100%] and I treated temperature change in these regions as linear. 
Hence, I chose them for further analysis.  
  Solving general trend line equation y = 0.01297*x^2 - 2.7251*x +109.0689 for chosen linear-behaved ranges of NH3 mass concentration gave me straight line equations.
Since I know exact line equations that describe boiling temperature change, I used them to determine temperature change with respect to NH3 mass percentage change by 1%.
To find ΔT (temperature change), I simply picked any two neighbour points on a x axis of a plot with increment of 1%, for instance 30% and 31% 57% and 58%, 74% and 
75%, 88% and 89%.

  As a result, ammonia-water solution boiling temperature drop (approximately) gradually decreases from 2.2 °C to 0.4 °C whilst solution concentration increases by 1%.
